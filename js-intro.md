# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

Functions are used to give out a set of instructions on how to perform task. We would use a function in case we wanted to address the values returned by the function later on.

#### 2. What is a method?

Methods are really similar to functions but they perform a really specific task that returns the result to the caller.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?

Some examples of string methods are:
-charAt() -concat() -length() -split() -toLowerCase -toUpperCase

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
An accessor method will check for a specified value while a mutator method will change it. It would really depend on what you're trying to do if you had to use one over the other.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

When using return, it gives you the ability to use what the function is returning as a variable. In the other hand, console.log() is basically a method that logs whatever you put in it to the console.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?

I think the assessment was really helpful since it lets you know your strengths and weaknesses.  

Note: Might've blown through all the questions, got home really late and am barely staying awake. Let me know if I need to re-do it.
